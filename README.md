## Description

The Date night application is designed to help individuals plan the perfect dinner and a movie date. The application takes in the users movie choice and zip code in order to provide a curated list of restaurants that would best go with their movie choice.

The motivation for building this project was to create an application that seamlessly uses multiple server-side APIs that work with each other.

The reason for creating this application was to remove the burden of having to pick the right eatery when going on a dinner and a movie date. We wanted the task of having to choose the right place to eat the last of our user's worries.
