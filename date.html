                    <p class="w3-padding w3-small">Awkward silence is the killer of promising first dates. Fortunately for us, Vanessa Van Edwards and the folks
                    over at Science of People have researched 13 great first-date questions to ensure you never have to endure that painful
                    silence! The only thing worse is bad small talk. These tips will help you banish both from your dates.</p> 

                    <p class="w3-padding w3-small">According to research, a flexible communication styleâ€”engaging questions, open-mindedness and easy back and forth is most effective.
                    Below, are a few favorite questions and conversation starters. Here is what they will do for you:</p>

                        <h5>Four Best First Date Conversation Starters:</h5> 
                        <p class="w3-padding-16"><b>Are you working on any personal passion projects?</b></p>
                        <p>This is a great go-to question and it comes up very naturally if someone talks about being busy, what they do for a living, or their hobbies.
                        It can transition you into a broad conversation about how they spend their time and sounds much better than "What are your hobbies?"
                        </p>

                        <p class="w3-padding-16"><b>What does a typical day look like for you?</b></p>
                        <p>Don't ask, "What do you do?" Instead, asking about their typical day will give you much more robust answers and you will learn far more about them.</p> 
                        
                        <p class="w3-padding-16"><b>Is there anything you don't eat?</b></p>
                        <p>Since we're doing dinner and a movie, this one will be easy. It can produce some fun conversation and might provide you with some great tidbits.</p>
                        
                        <p class="w3-padding-16"><b>What sort of vacations do you like to take?</b></p> 
                        <p>People often ask, "Have you gone on any vacations recently?" However, someone can answer 
                        that very quickly or they might not have gone anywhere (which can result in awkward silence). Asking about their likes produces conversation and can even get you a second
                        date! Professor Richard Wiseman conducted a study and found that 18% of couples who discuss travel went on a second date, compaired to 9% of couples who talked
                        only about movies.</p><br>
